# Chatlang

**Chatlang** is a programming language which is meant to resemble a log from a chatroom. Below is a sample program that prints "Hello World!":

```
[9:44] Coizioc: Say "Hello World!".
```

For more examples of programs written in Chatlang, check out the [examples](examples) directory in this repo.

The design of Chatlang is inspired mostly by [Rockstar](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Rockstar) and [FiM++](https://esolangs.org/wiki/FiM++).

If you would like to write programs using Chatlang, the language specification can be found [here](spec.md).

This repo also contains a Python interpreter for Chatlang. To run a file using it, type `python chatlang.py [FILENAME]` into a command prompt.
